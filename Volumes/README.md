# Docker Volumes
Docker volumes are used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. This guide will help you understand the basics of Docker volumes and how to use them.

## What are Docker Volumes?

Docker volumes are a way to store data outside of the container's filesystem. They are managed by Docker and can be used to share data between containers or persist data even after the container is removed.

## Types of Docker Volumes

1. **Named Volumes**: These are volumes that are given a specific name and can be reused across multiple containers.
2. **Anonymous Volumes**: These are volumes that are not given a specific name and are typically used for temporary storage.
3. **Host Volumes**: These are volumes that map a directory on the host machine to a directory in the container.

## Basic Commands

### Create a Volume

```sh
docker volume create task_volume
```

### List Volumes

```sh
docker volume ls
```

### Inspect a Volume

```sh
docker volume inspect task_volume
```

### Remove a Volume

```sh
docker volume rm task_volume
```

## Using Volumes in Containers

### Mounting a Named Volume

```sh
docker run -d --name my_task -v task_volume:/app/data my_image
```

### Mounting a Host Volume

```sh
docker run -d --name my_task -v /host/data:/app/data my_image
```
